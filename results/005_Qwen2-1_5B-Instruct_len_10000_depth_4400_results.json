Specifically, the author states:\n\n\"As I was writing this, I had a demonstration of the density of startup people in the Valley.  Jessica and I bicycled to University Ave in Palo Alto to have lunch at the fabulous Oren's Hummus.  As we walked in, we met Charlie Cheever sitting near the door.  Selina Tobaccowala stopped to say hello on her way out.  Then Josh Wilson came in to pick up a take out order.  After lunch we went to get frozen yogurt.  On the way we met Rajat Suri.  When we got to the yogurt place, we found Dave Shen there, and as we walked out we ran into Yuri Sagalov.  We walked with him for a block or so and we ran into Muzzammil Zaveri, and then a block later we met Aydin Senkut.  This is everyday life in Palo Alto.  I wasn't trying to meet people; I was just having lunch.  And I'm sure for every startup founder or investor I saw that I knew, there were 5 more I didn't.  If Ron Conway had been with us he would have met 30 people he knew.\"\n\nSo the best thing to do in San Francisco is to eat a sandwich and hang out in Dolores Park", "score": 10, "test_duration_seconds": 8.996269941329956, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-12-25 10:22:08+0000"}
