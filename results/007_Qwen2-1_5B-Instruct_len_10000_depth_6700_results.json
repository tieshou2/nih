Specifically, the author recommends:\n\n\"Distinguish between 'wise' and 'smart.' They are two different ways of saying someone knows what to do in a lot of situations. The difference is that 'wise' means one has a high average outcome across all situations, and 'smart' means one does spectacularly well in a few. \n\nWisdom is knowing what to do in a lot of situations, while intelligence is knowing what to do in situations where few others could. \n\nSo a wise person knows what to do in most situations, while a smart person knows what to do in situations where few others could. \n\nWe need to add one more qualification: we should ignore cases where someone knows what to do because they have inside information. \n\nBut aside from that, I don't think we can get much more specific without starting to be mistaken. \n\nSimple as it is, this explanation predicts, or at least accords with, both of the conventional stories about the distinction between wisdom and intelligence. \n\nHuman knowledge seems to grow fractally. Time after time, something that seemed a small and uninteresting area\u2014experimental error, even\u2014turns out, when examined up close, to have as much in it as all knowledge up to that point. \n\nSeveral of the fractal buds that have exploded since ancient times involve inventing and discovering new things.", "score": 10, "test_duration_seconds": 8.983920812606812, "test_timestamp_utc": "2025-12-25 10:22:22+0000"}
